# fibers

This project aims to evaluate the concept of using Fibers instead normal Java Threads.

Instructions after run: 
- Use postgres. It's necessary to simulate a delayed query. (pg_sleep) See PersonRepository.java
- Configure a database called: fibers (you can destroy it after tests)
- Use the agent that is in path: /src/main/resources/agent/quasar-core-0.7.9.jar (run with javaagent)

Enjoy!
