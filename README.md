# Fibers

This project aims to evaluate the concept of using Fibers instead normal Java Threads.

<br />

## Getting started
Starts the postgres docker container for JPA test with this command-line:
<br />
```
$ docker run -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_DB=fibers -d postgres
```
Do not forget to change the port if you have a postgres service running in your machine.
<br />

## Usage
Use the agent that is in the path: `/src/main/resources/agent/quasar-core-0.7.9.jar` (run with javaagent)

<b>Enjoy!</b>
